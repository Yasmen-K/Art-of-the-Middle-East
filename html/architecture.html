                Islamic architecture is one of the world's most celebrated building traditions. Known for its radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes, this distinctive approach has been popular in the Muslim world since the 7th century.

                While Islamic architecture comprises several styles across different countries and continents, there are certain characteristics that remain universally prevalent throughout. Recognizing these underlying elements—as well as understanding its geographical prevalence—is key to grasping the visually sensational and historically significant style.
                
                Islamic architecture comprises the architectural styles of buildings associated with Islam. It encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of Islam to the present day. Islamic architecture developed to fulfill Islamic religious ideals, for example, the Minar was designed to assist the Muezzin in making his voice heard to throughout a specific area.
    
                Many of the buildings which are mentioned in this article are listed as World Heritage Sites.
    
                Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Persian, Mesopotamian architecture and all other lands which the Early Muslim conquests conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries.Further east, it was also influenced by Chinese and Mughal architecture as Islam spread to Southeast Asia. Later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings, and the decoration of surfaces with Islamic calligraphy and geometric and interlace patterned ornament. New architectural elements like cylindrical minarets, muqarnas, arabesque, multifoil were invented. The principal Islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are: the mosque, the tomb, the palace, and the fort. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths, fountains and domestic architecture.
    
                Some prominent examples of Islamic architecture, like the Citadel of Aleppo, have suffered significant damage in the ongoing Syrian Civil War and other wars in the Middle East.

               This architectural tradition is predominantly found in two types of places: Muslim-majority countries and lands conquered by Muslims during the Middle Ages. In addition to Arab states—like Algeria, Egypt, and Iraq—Islamic architecture is also prevalent in European regions with Moorish roots, including parts of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Malta.

            Though often associated with the Islamic mosque—Muslims' place of worship—this approach to architecture is also apparent in other edifices, from palaces and public buildings to tombs and forts. Whether religious or secular, however, the splendid style is defined by several common characteristics.

            A minaret is a spire or tower-like structure featuring small windows and an enclosed staircase. It is one of the oldest elements of Islamic architecture, and is found next to most mosques. The primary function of the minaret is to allow the muezzin to call worshippers to prayer from an elevated point. This occurs five times a day: at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and night.
            Since the 11th century, some mosques have been outfitted with more than one minaret, traditionally indicating that it had been founded by a sultan.

                DOMES

            <p>

                <div class="wrapper-dome">
                    <img src="../images/architecture/Jāmeh Mosque of Isfahān.png" alt="" class="dome">

                Like many pioneering architectural movements—including Byzantine and Italian Renaissance building traditions—Islamic architects also incorporate domes into their designs.

                The Dome of the Rock, a 7th-century shrine in Jerusalem, is the first Islamic building to feature this architectural element. Inspired by Byzantine plans, the octagonal edifice is topped with a wooden dome, which was plated in gold during the 16th century. Unlike most Islamic domes—which rest on pendentives—the dome sits on a drum supported by 16 piers and columns.
                Pendentives are tapered structures that allow a circular base for a round or elliptical dome to be placed on a square or rectangular room. In Islamic architecture, pendentives are often decorated with tiles or muqarnas, a type of sculptural decoration.

                MUQARNAS VAULTING
            </h3>

            <p>

                <div class="wrapper-muqarnas-vaulting">

                </div>

                Three-dimensional decorative device used widely in Islamic architecture, in which tiers of individual elements, including niche-like cells, brackets and pendants, are projected over those below.
                Due to their sculptural composition and patterned aesthetic, Muqarnas are often compared to stalactites or honeycomb. In addition to domes and pendentives, this unique ornamentation also adorns vaults, culminating in monochromatic, sculptural ceilings that contrast the surrounding tiles.
            </p>

            <h3>
                ARCHES
            </h3>

            <p>

                <div class="wrapper-arches">
                    <img src="../images/architecture/arches_1.png" alt="" class="arches">
                    <div class="dot-container">
                        
                        <span class="dot arches-first active" ></span>
                        <span class="dot arches-second" ></span>
                      </div>

                </div>
                Another fixture of Islamic architecture is the arch. Evident in both entrances and interiors, Islamic arches are categorized into four main styles: pointed, ogee, horseshoe, and multifoil.

                The pointed arch features a rounded design with a tapered apex. This type of arch would eventually become an important element of Gothic architecture.
                The ogee arch is similar to the pointed arch. However, its point is composed of two s-shaped lines, culminating in a more sinuous silhouette.

                The horseshoe arch (also known as a keyhole arch) is associated with Moorish architecture. As its crown can be either rounded or pointed, this type of structure is defined by the dramatic widening and narrowing of its sides.
                Like the horseshoe arch, the multifoil arch is characteristic of Moorish architecture. This arch features multiple foils, or “leaves,” resulting in a scalloped shape.

                DECORATIVE DETAILS

            <p>
                <div class="wrapper-decoration">

                        <span class="dot decoration-second" ></span>
                      </div>

                </div>
                A final element of Islamic architecture is an attention to ornamental detail. Often reserved for interiors, this lavish approach to decoration includes jewel-like tiles arranged into geometric mosaics, patterned brickwork and kaleidoscopic stones, and exquisite calligraphic adornments.
                Along with monumental domes, mesmerizing muqarnas vaulting, and distinctive arches, these eye-catching embellishments exhibit the transcendent nature of the Islamic building practice.
